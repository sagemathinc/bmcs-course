# Brittle Matrix Composite Structures

The course is divided into three blocks related to detailed theoretical and experimental description of (1) bond, debonding process, anchorage, (2) crack initiation and propagation, and (3) multiple cracking, matrix fragmentation process under elementary loading conditions. Each of these aspects is first treated in an abstract way using theoretical and numerical methods. The general part is followed with examples of particular types of material components and practical tasks related to the either material development, design & dimensioning or safety assessment of structures.
